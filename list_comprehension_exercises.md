# 📝 Python List Comprehension & String Filtering Practice

## 🔹 Basic List Comprehension

1. Create a list of squares for numbers from 1 to 10 using list comprehension.
2. Generate a list of even numbers from 1 to 20 using list comprehension.
3. Create a list of the lengths of words in the list `["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]`.

## 🔹 String Filtering

4. Given a list of words, create a new list containing only words that start with the letter `'b'`.
5. Filter a list of strings to include only those that have more than 5 characters.
6. Extract words that contain at least one vowel (`'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'`).

## 🔹 Advanced Filtering

7. Given a list of email addresses, extract only those ending with `".com"`.
8. Find all words in a list that contain both `'a'` and `'e'`.
9. Create a list of words from a given sentence that do not contain the letter `'s'`.

## 🔹 Number Operations

10. Generate a list of numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 from 1 to 100.
11. Create a list of numbers that are prime from 1 to 50.
12. Convert a list of temperatures in Celsius `[0, 20, 30, 40]` to Fahrenheit using list comprehension.

## 🔹 Nested List Comprehension

13. Generate a 2D list (matrix) where each row contains numbers from 1 to 5.
14. Flatten a nested list `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]` using list comprehension.
15. Create a list of all possible pairs from two different lists `["red", "blue"]` and `[1, 2, 3]`.
